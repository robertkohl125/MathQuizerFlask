# MathQuizerFlask
========================

THis is the second attempt to create a MathQuizer page for students learning math concepts. The final version will have links to helpful pages, logins for parents with data on their child's work, and an arithmatic practice page where students can shasrpen their skills.
The Arithmatic practive will involve allowing the student to select the operator and how many digits the problem is. 
There will also be rewards for accomplishing tasks.
